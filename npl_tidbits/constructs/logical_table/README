Description:
============
This program illustrates how to use NPL's 'logical_table' construct and provides sandbox for experimenting.

The logical_table construct is used to specify lookup tables in NPL program.
In this example, we are using logical_table with type as Index.
VLAN_TABLE used in this example is indexed using vlan_id of packet & determines
   list of ports that incoming packet can be forwarded.

Compile & Run the program:
==========================
To compile 'logical_tbl' program, run following commands from program directory:
   * make fe_nplsim
   * make nplsim_comp
At this point, all files needed to run NPL Behavior Model (BM) are generated.
There are two options to run 'logical_tbl' program with NPL BM.
   1. If xterm is supported, just run: 
      *   make nplsim_run    (this is simple and easy way to run)
   2. If xterm is NOT supported then:  (manually running BM components)
      2a. Open two terminal windows and browse to 'logical_tbl' program directory.
      2b. Terminal-1: Run 'logical_tbl' program's Behavior Model:
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> ./fe_output/bmodel/bin/bmodel.sim
      2c. Terminal-2: Run Behavior Model CLI program.
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> python $BRCM_NCS_ROOT/ncsc-x.x.x/bmi/cli/bmif_cli.py --regfile ./fe_output/regfiles/nplsim_physical_regsfile.yml


Packet Test:
============
Default packet generation script included with the program does following:
 (a). Send vlan-2 packet to port-0 of BM.
      Receive packet from BM on port-2 and print hexdump.
 (b). Send vlan-3 packet to port-0 of BM.
      Receive packet from BM on port-3 and print hexdump.

To run the test, open terminal and browse to 'logical_tbl' program directory.
Run the following packet generation script included with the program.
   :> python bm_tests/corp_net/testPkt.py


*BM  :- Behavior Model
*BMI :- Behavior Model Infrastructure
