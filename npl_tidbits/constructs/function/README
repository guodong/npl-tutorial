Description:
============
This program illustrates how to use NPL's 'function' construct and provides sandbox for experimenting.

'fun_ip_hash_calc' program does following:
  * Parse incoming packet.
  * Do hash calculation by using packet's source & destination IP, source & destination TCP/UDP port and protocol in use.
  * Assign the hash value to a bus field.
  * Calculated hash value is printed on BM console.

|-- npl
|   |-- fun_ip_hash_calc.npl  (main program code)
|   |-- base_helper.npl   (support code that is needed for program to compile & execute)
|-- config.ini            (configuration file that can be used as-is)
|-- Makefile              
|-- bm_tests              (Scripts to support topology, packet crafting, packet send & receive)

Compile & Run the program:
==========================
To compile 'fun_ip_hash_calc' program, run following commands from program directory:
   * make fe_nplsim
   * make nplsim_comp
At this point, all files needed to run NPL Behavior Model (BM) are generated.
There are two options to run 'fun_ip_hash_calc' program with NPL BM.
   1. If xterm is supported, just run: 
      *   make nplsim_run    (this is simple and easy way to run)
   2. If xterm is NOT supported then:  (manually running BM components)
      2a. Open two terminal windows and browse to 'fun_ip_hash_calc' program directory.
      2b. Terminal-1: Run 'fun_ip_hash_calc' program's Behavior Model:
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> ./fe_output/bmodel/bin/bmodel.sim
      2c. Terminal-2: Run Behavior Model CLI program.
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> python $BRCM_NCS_ROOT/ncsc-x.x.x/bmi/cli/bmif_cli.py --regfile ./fe_output/regfiles/nplsim_physical_regsfile.yml


Packet Test:
============
Default packet generation script included with the program does following:
   Input : Sends following packets through port-0 of BehaviorModel:
           a. Sends a TCP packet with src_port = dst_port = 0.
           b. Sends a UDP packet with src_port = 0x1234 and dst_port=0x5678 
   Output: On Behavior Model console, calculated hash_value is printed.


To run the test, open terminal and browse to 'fun_ip_hash_calc' program directory.
Run the following packet generation script included with the program.
   :> python bm_tests/corp_net/testPkt.py
