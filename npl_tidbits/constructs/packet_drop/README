Description:
============
This program illustrates how to use NPL's 'packet count' construct and provides sandbox for experimenting.

'packet_drop' program implements simple mac-address value checker. The program checks if incoming packet's source-mac-address (or) destination-mac-address are zero. If one of the values is zero then packet will be dropped.

|   |-- packet_drop.npl  (main program code)
|   |-- base_helper.npl   (support code that is needed for program to compile & execute)
|-- config.ini            (configuration file that can be used as-is)
|-- Makefile              
|-- bm_tests              (Scripts to support topology, packet crafting, packet send & receive)

Compile & Run the program:
==========================
To compile 'packet_drop' program, run following commands from program directory:
   * make fe_nplsim
   * make nplsim_comp
At this point, all files needed to run NPL Behavior Model (BM) are generated.
There are two options to run 'packet_drop' program with NPL BM.
   1. If xterm is supported, just run: 
      *   make nplsim_run    (this is simple and easy way to run)
   2. If xterm is NOT supported then:  (manually running BM components)
      2a. Open two terminal windows and browse to 'packet_drop' program directory.
      2b. Terminal-1: Run 'packet_drop' program's Behavior Model:
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> ./fe_output/bmodel/bin/bmodel.sim
      2c. Terminal-2: Run Behavior Model CLI program.
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> python $BRCM_NCS_ROOT/ncsc-x.x.x/bmi/cli/bmif_cli.py --regfile ./fe_output/regfiles/nplsim_physical_regsfile.yml

Packet Test:
============
Default packet generation script included with the program does following:
   1. Input : Send a normal packet through port-0 of BM.
   2. Input : Send a MAC_SA=0 packet through port-0 of BM.
      Output : packet drop and drop_vector set to 1.
   3. Input : Send a MAC_DA=0 packet through port-0 of BM.
      Output : packet drop and drop_vector set to 2.

To run the test, open terminal and browse to 'packet_drop' program directory.
Run the following packet generation script included with the program.
   :> python bm_tests/corp_net/testPkt.py

*BM  :- Behavior Model
*BMI :- Behavior Model Infrastructure
