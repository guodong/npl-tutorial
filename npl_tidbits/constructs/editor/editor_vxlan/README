Description:
============
This program illustrates how to use NPL's 'editor' constructs and provides 
sandbox for experiments.

'editor_vxlan' program does the following:
  * Parse incoming packet.
  * Checks for VxLAN header in incoming packet.
  * If incoming packet has VxLAN header, deletes VxLAN header from outgoing 
  * packet.
  * If incoming packet des not have VxLAN header then adds VxLAN header to 
  * outgoing packet.

Following editor constructs are used to modify outgoing packets:
  1. add_header           :- Add new header to packet.
  2. delete_header        :- Deletes a header from packet header stack.
  3. replace_header_field :- Replace a header field with a bus field or another 
                             header field.
  4. update_packet_length :- Updates packet length.
  5. create_checksum      :- create checksum.

Compile & Run the program:
==========================
To compile 'editor_vxlan' program, run following commands from program directory:
   * make fe_nplsim
   * make nplsim_comp
At this point, all files needed to run NPL Behavior Model (BM) are generated.
There are two options to run 'editor_vxlan' program with NPL BM.
   1. If xterm is supported, just run: 
      *   make nplsim_run    (this is simple and easy way to run)
   2. If xterm is NOT supported then:  (manually running BM components)
      2a. Open two terminal windows and browse to 'editor_vxlan' program directory.
      2b. Terminal-1: Run 'editor_vxlan' program's Behavior Model:
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> ./fe_output/bmodel/bin/bmodel.sim
      2c. Terminal-2: Run Behavior Model CLI program.
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> python $BRCM_NCS_ROOT/ncsc-x.x.x/bmi/cli/bmif_cli.py --regfile ./fe_output/regfiles/nplsim_physical_regsfile.yml

Packet Test:
============
Default packet generation script included with the program does the following:
   1:
      Input : Sends a non-VXLAN packet from port-0.
      Output: Received packet is a VXLAN packet, VXLAN header is added.
   2:
      Input : Sends a VXLAN packet from port-0.
      Output: Received packet is a non-VXLAN packet, VXLAN header is removed. 

To run the test, open terminal and browse to 'editor_vxlan' program directory.
Run the following packet generation script included with the program.
   :> python bm_tests/corp_net/testPkt.py
